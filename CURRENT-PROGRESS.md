# Current Progress — Anagrams

## Commit history

### `feat/initial-game` — Initial playable game (this commit)

Brand-new repository scaffolding plus a complete, playable Anagrams MVP.

#### Tooling
- Vite 7 + Vue 3 SPA, identical setup to `~/code/games/reword`.
- Vitest + happy-dom for unit + component tests.
- `npm run build-dict` downloads TWL06 + filters profanity → `data/dictionary.json`.

#### Domain modules (under `src/`)
- `prng.js` — `cyrb128`, `sfc32`, `getDailyRng`, `getRandomRng`, `seededShuffle`,
  `seededPick` (ported from reword).
- `tiles.js` — Bananagrams letter distribution (144 tiles); `createTileSet`,
  `shuffleTiles`.
- `pool.js` — immutable three-pool state (`faceDown`, `looseLetters`, `words`);
  `createPool`, `drawTile`, `formWord`, `isFaceDownEmpty`.
- `dictionary.js` — `loadDictionary` returning `{ isWord, signatureIndex }`;
  signature-based anagram lookup.
- `trivialInflection.js` — port of reword's `isTrivialInflection` (uses
  `wink-lemmatizer` + override list for drop-e edge cases).
- `anagramRules.js` — `canFormWord(typed, board, dict)` enforces all
  spec restrictions: length ≥ 3, in-dictionary, not-profane, must use ALL
  letters of any consumed preexisting word, not a trivial inflection,
  not a no-op replay.
- `scoring.js` — `scoreWord(w) = w.length²`; `hasLoosePoolAnagram` (signature
  subset enumeration up to size 8); `finalScore = sum − 10·missed_draws`.
- `game.js` — `createGame`, `drawTile`, `submitWord`, `endGame` orchestrator.
- `share.js` — Wordle-style share text (mode + score + longest length + time).

#### UI (under `src/components/`)
- `App.vue` — top-level `home / game / score` state machine, lazy-loads the
  bundled dictionary on first start.
- `HomeScreen.vue` — Daily Challenge / Random Trial buttons + rules summary.
- `GameScreen.vue` — face-up tile rack, word list, typed-input + Submit + Draw,
  live timer, live score.
- `ScoreScreen.vue` — final score grid, longest word transformation chain,
  Share button (clipboard copy).

#### Tests (`tests/`)
- `prng.test.js`, `tiles.test.js`, `pool.test.js`, `dictionary.test.js`,
  `trivialInflection.test.js`, `anagramRules.test.js`, `scoring.test.js`,
  `game.test.js`, `share.test.js`, `app.smoke.test.js`. All 70 tests green.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 71/71 passing.
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds, dictionary emitted as asset.
- `npm run dev` — boots; HTML, vue components, dictionary asset all served.

#### Post-review fixes applied
- `wink-lemmatizer` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` (was
  imported at runtime by `src/trivialInflection.js`).
- `game.history` (append-only) added so `endGame.buildChain` can reconstruct
  the longest-word transformation even after parent words have been
  consumed by `formWord`. Final score now sums history (rewards each step
  of `fine → refine → redefine`), not just on-table words.
- Smoke test now asserts on the feedback message text, not just its
  presence.

### `feat/initial-game` — Click-to-stage tile interaction (this commit)

Adds a hybrid input model: clicks on face-up tiles or on existing word rows
append letters to the typed input as a fast shortcut. Live multiset
highlighting shows which tiles and word groups are claimed by the current
input.

#### New / changed
- `src/staging.js` (new) — `highlightConsumption(typed, pool)` returns
  `{ words: Set<idx>, loose: Set<idx> }`. Greedy multiset matching: claim
  each existing word in order if it fits, then leftmost-first per letter
  for residual loose tiles. No dictionary / profanity check — purely a UI
  hint. `canFormWord` remains the source of truth at submit time.
- `src/components/GameScreen.vue` — face-up tile spans and word rows are
  now `clickable` with `@mousedown.prevent` handlers (`onTileClick`,
  `onWordClick`). A `consumption` computed property feeds `used` (loose
  tiles) and `consumed` (word rows) classes from
  `highlightConsumption`.
- `style.css` — `.tile.clickable` cursor + hover transform; `.word-row`
  rounded background container, `.word-row.clickable` hover, and
  `.word-row.consumed` accent (green tint + inset border).

#### Tests added
- `tests/staging.test.js` — 10 unit tests for `highlightConsumption`:
  empty input, single match, leftmost-of-duplicates, multi-letter, full
  word coverage, partial-coverage rejection, steal scenarios,
  over-consumption skipping, unclaimable extras (still claim what fits),
  case-insensitive.
- `tests/gameScreenInteraction.test.js` — 6 component tests covering
  click-to-append (tile + word), cumulative clicks, `used` class on
  matched loose tiles, `consumed` class on fully-covered words,
  no `consumed` on partial coverage.
- `tests/app.smoke.test.js` — added a smoke test asserting tile-click
  flows through the App boundary into the input box.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 88/88 passing (10 staging + 6 gameScreenInteraction + 1
  app smoke addition + 71 prior).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds (≈1.8 MB JS, identical to
  prior commit; CSS now 5.78 kB up from 5.31 kB).
- `npm run dev` — boots; HTML, vue components, dictionary asset all
  served. Tiles and word rows respond to clicks.

### `feat/initial-game` — Wordle-style share grid (this commit)

Replaces the flat-text share output with a Wordle-style emoji block that
visually summarises the player's run, satisfying APPLICATION-SPEC.md's
"share button (come up with something clever that we can use that is
wordle style)" requirement.

#### Format

```
Anagrams 2026-04-25 — 142

🟩🟩🟩🟩
🟨🟨🟨🟨🟩🟩
🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟩🟩

Longest 8 · Time 5:00
```

Per row: 🟨 count = sum of consumed parent-word lengths (recycled
letters); 🟩 count = remainder (newly-added letters). Random mode shows
`Anagrams Random — <score>` instead of a date. Empty history → header +
footer only, no emoji rows.

#### New / changed
- `src/share.js` — rewritten. New optional `history` param; emits header
  + emoji rows + footer. Uses U+1F7E9 / U+1F7E8 (large green/yellow
  squares) for portability across Discord / iMessage / Twitter without
  variation selectors. No row padding — emoji widths are not consistent
  across renderers (VS Code / Discord desktop / iMessage all differ);
  ragged left-aligned rows are the convention.
- `src/game.js` — `endGame` result now exposes `history` so the score
  screen can hand it to the share function.
- `src/components/ScoreScreen.vue` — passes `result.history` into
  `generateShareText`.

#### Tests added
- `tests/share.test.js` — 6 new emoji-grid tests covering: empty
  history, all-green original word, single-parent steal (yellow + green
  mix), three-row chain (`fine → refine → redefine`), multi-parent
  all-yellow steal, footer format with longest length and time.
- Pre-existing share tests (date / score / longest-length / random
  header / determinism) continue to pass — the new format still contains
  those substrings.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 96/96 passing (was 90; +6 new share tests).
- No changes to game logic, scoring, or anagram rules.

### `feat/initial-game` — Click-to-remove + Clear button (this commit)

Makes the click-to-stage interaction reversible. Clicking a tile/word
that is already claimed by the typed input now *removes* its letters.
Adds a "Clear" button that resets the typed input in one action.

#### New / changed
- `src/components/GameScreen.vue`:
  - `onTileClick(i)`: if `consumption.loose.has(i)`, remove the first
    occurrence of that letter from `typed` (case-insensitive). Else
    append (existing behavior).
  - `onWordClick(i)`: if `consumption.words.has(i)`, remove the word's
    letters from `typed` one-at-a-time, leftmost-first per letter. Else
    append.
  - New `onClear()` resets `typed` to `''` and clears feedback.
  - Two inline pure-string helpers: `removeFirstOccurrence(s, ch)` and
    `removeWordLetters(s, word)`.
  - Template: new `<button type="button">Clear</button>` between the
    input and Submit, disabled while `typed === ''`.
- No CSS changes needed — existing `.action-btn` + `.action-btn:disabled`
  styles cover the new button.
- No domain-module changes (`staging.js`, `anagramRules.js`, `game.js`,
  `scoring.js`, `pool.js`, etc. are untouched).

#### Tests added
- `tests/gameScreenInteraction.test.js`:
  - "removes the letter from input when an already-claimed tile is
    clicked" (replaces the previous "does not append" no-op test).
  - "removes the entire word's letters from input when an
    already-consumed word row is clicked" (typed='brook', word='rook'
    → typed='b').
  - "removes only the letters of the clicked word, leaving extras
    intact" (typed='barook' with extras 'b','a' loose → typed='ba').
  - "removes letters case-insensitively when input is uppercase".
  - "renders a Clear button that resets typed input when clicked".
  - "Clear button is disabled when typed input is empty".
  - "Clear button is enabled when typed input is non-empty".
- `tests/app.smoke.test.js`:
  - "Clear button empties the typed input from the App boundary".

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 103/103 passing (was 96; +7 new + 1 replaced).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds, no size change.

#### Known limitation (documented in RESEARCH-NOTES.md)
- With duplicate letters, clicking the leftmost-of-letter claimed tile
  causes the rightmost-of-letter to lose its highlight instead. This is
  intrinsic to the multiset-claim model; fixing it requires switching
  to an explicit staged-array model (out of scope for a polish commit).
  Backspace and Clear both work as fallbacks.

### `feat/initial-game` — Daily streak + best-score persistence (this commit)

Adds a localStorage-backed persistence layer that records each finished
Daily Challenge run, derives a current streak (consecutive UTC days)
and a best score, and surfaces both on the Home and Score screens. The
share text grows a ` · Streak <N>` suffix in daily mode when the streak
is ≥ 2. Random Trial games never touch storage. No domain-module
changes.

#### New / changed
- `src/storage.js` (new) — pure functions over an injected storage
  shim. `loadStore` is robust to missing key / malformed JSON / wrong
  schemaVersion / `getItem` throws. `recordDailyResult` is keep-first
  per date (Wordle convention) and swallows `setItem` failures
  (Safari Private Mode quota=0). `currentStreak` walks back day-by-day,
  preserving the streak when today is missing but yesterday is
  present. `bestScore` and `hasCompletedDate` are pure derivations.
  `browserStorage()` returns `window.localStorage` after a probe write,
  else a no-op shim. Schema: `{ schemaVersion: 1, records: { 'YYYY-MM-DD':
  { score, longestWord, durationMs, completedAt } } }` under the single
  key `anagrams:v1`. Streak and best are NEVER persisted as
  denormalized state.
- `src/share.js` — `generateShareText` accepts an optional `streak`
  param; appends ` · Streak <N>` to the footer when `mode === 'daily'`
  and `streak ≥ 2`. Backwards-compatible: omitted/0/1 produces the
  prior output exactly.
- `src/components/HomeScreen.vue` — accepts `streak`, `best`,
  `completedToday` props. Renders a small stats row when either is
  non-zero; "✓ Played today" sub-label on the Daily Challenge button
  when `completedToday` is true.
- `src/components/ScoreScreen.vue` — accepts `streak`, `isNewBest`
  props; renders a streak / "New best!" pill row in daily mode. Passes
  `streak` to `generateShareText`.
- `src/components/App.vue` — owns a `stats` ref. `computeStats()` reads
  storage and derives `{ streak, best, completedToday }`. On
  `endGameWithResult` for daily games, snapshots the previous best
  *before* calling `recordDailyResult` (keep-first means reading after
  the write would always tie or lose), then sets `isNewBest`. Stats
  recompute on home and score transitions.
- `style.css` — `.home-stats`, `.home-stat`, `.played-today-tag`,
  `.score-streak-row`, `.score-streak`, `.new-best-pill`. Dark palette
  consistent with existing rules.

#### Tests added
- `tests/storage.test.js` (new) — 19 unit tests against a `Map`-backed
  fake storage shim. Covers `loadStore` (empty / malformed / wrong
  schemaVersion), `recordDailyResult` (round-trip / keep-first /
  quota-exceeded swallow / `wasNewRecord` flag), `currentStreak`
  (empty / today-only / N consecutive ending today / N consecutive
  ending yesterday / 2-day-old gap / trailing-run-only / month and
  year boundaries), `bestScore` (empty / max), `hasCompletedDate`.
- `tests/share.test.js` — 4 new tests for the streak suffix
  (daily+streak≥2 contains `Streak N`, streak=1 absent, omitted/0
  absent, random+streak absent).
- `tests/app.smoke.test.js` — `localStorage` stubbed in `beforeEach`;
  new test pre-seeds storage with two daily records and verifies the
  home screen shows "Streak", "Best", and the seeded high score.

#### Documentation
- `src/docs.md` (new) — noridoc covering domain core (game lifecycle,
  three-pool model, anagram rules, scoring, dictionary), the new
  storage layer's keep-first / derived-stats invariants, and the
  share-text contract.
- `src/components/docs.md` (new) — noridoc covering App.vue as the sole
  storage caller, the previous-best-snapshot ordering, the
  date-as-PRNG-seed-and-storage-key convention, and the props/events
  boundary.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 128/128 passing (was 104; +19 storage + 4 share + 1
  smoke).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly (CSS now 6.54 kB
  up from 5.78 kB; JS unchanged at ≈1.82 MB).
- `npm run dev` — boots; index.html, components, dictionary asset all
  served. HomeScreen now exposes `streak`, `best`, `completedToday`
  props.

### `feat/initial-game` — Bundle slim-down via precomputed lemmas (this commit)

Pre-computes the trivial-inflection lemma table at dictionary-build
time and removes `wink-lemmatizer` from the runtime dependency tree.
Cuts the production JS bundle from 1.82 MB → 93 kB (95% reduction);
gzipped JS drops from 633 kB → 36 kB. Runtime semantics of
`isTrivialInflection` are preserved exactly.

#### Why
`wink-lemmatizer` (used at runtime only by
`src/trivialInflection.js`) transitively pulls in `wink-lexicon`,
which ships ~3 MB of WordNet/lexicon JSON — most of the 1.8 MB JS
bundle. The lookup data the game actually needs is small and finite,
so we precompute it offline.

#### New / changed
- `scripts/build-lemmas.js` (new) — maintainer-only script. Exports
  `buildLemmaIndex(words)` (pure helper) and a `main()` that reads
  `data/dictionary.json` and writes `data/lemmas.json`. Imports
  `wink-lemmatizer`; this is the **only** file that does. Wired up
  via `npm run build-lemmas`.
- `data/lemmas.json` (new, committed) — schema
  `{ lemmas: { word: [lemma1, lemma2?] } }`. ~55,500 entries,
  1.36 MB raw / 267 kB gzipped. Identity entries omitted; lemma list
  deduped; non-vocabulary lemmas filtered.
- `src/trivialInflection.js` — rewritten. Removed
  `import lem from 'wink-lemmatizer'`. New signature
  `isTrivialInflection(answer, root, lemmaIndex)`. `lemmaIndex`
  accepts either a `Map<string, string[]>` or a plain object. The
  `FORCE_NON_TRIVIAL` override list and trailing-`e` drop-e
  heuristic are preserved verbatim; the heuristic now checks
  `lemmas.includes(r.slice(0,-1))` instead of calling the lemmatizer.
- `src/dictionary.js` — `loadDictionary(json, lemmasJson?)` gained an
  optional second arg. The returned object now exposes
  `dict.lemmaIndex` (a `Map<string, string[]>`). When `lemmasJson` is
  omitted, `lemmaIndex` is empty (back-compat for tests).
- `src/anagramRules.js` — `canFormWord` threads `dict.lemmaIndex`
  into the `isTrivialInflection(word, w, dict.lemmaIndex)` call.
- `src/components/App.vue` — `ensureDictionary` now `Promise.all`s
  fetches of `data/dictionary.json` and `data/lemmas.json`, then
  `Promise.all`s the two `.json()` parses, then calls
  `loadDictionary(dictJson, lemmasJson)`.
- `package.json` — `wink-lemmatizer` moved from `dependencies` to
  `devDependencies`. New `npm run build-lemmas` script.

#### Tests added
- `tests/buildLemmas.test.js` (new) — 5 unit tests for
  `buildLemmaIndex`: maps inflected words → lemma when in vocab,
  maps simple plurals → singular, omits identity-only words, captures
  the over-stem case (`rated → rat`) so the trailing-`e` heuristic
  fires, omits entries whose only candidates are absent from the
  vocabulary.
- `tests/trivialInflection.test.js` — rewritten to thread a fixture
  lemma `Map` through every assertion. Same 12 spec-rule assertions
  still hold.
- `tests/anagramRules.test.js`, `tests/game.test.js`,
  `tests/app.smoke.test.js` — updated to also load
  `data/lemmas.json` and pass it through `loadDictionary`. The smoke
  test's `fetch` stub now discriminates by URL to return either
  dictionary or lemmas JSON.

#### Bundle impact
- **Before:** `dist/assets/index-*.js` 1,819 kB raw / 633 kB gzipped.
- **After:** `dist/assets/index-*.js` 93 kB raw / 36 kB gzipped (95%
  smaller). New `dist/assets/lemmas-*.json` 1,357 kB raw / 267 kB
  gzipped, lazy-fetched in parallel with the dictionary on first
  game start.
- **Total raw payload** (JS + dict + lemmas): 3,937 kB → 3,568 kB.
- **Gzipped payload:** 1,110 kB → 780 kB. Crucially, **initial JS**
  drops from 633 kB gzipped to 36 kB gzipped — first paint is now
  near-instant.
- **Build time:** 89 s → 0.6 s (147× faster, since wink-lexicon's
  massive JSON no longer needs to be transformed by Vite/Rollup).

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 132/132 passing (was 127; +5 buildLemmas).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds in 0.6 s.
- `npm run build-lemmas` — regenerates `data/lemmas.json`
  deterministically from `data/dictionary.json` (offline).

### `feat/initial-game` — Keyboard / accessibility pass (this commit)

Closes the long-standing keyboard-reach gap on the rack and player-word
list. Before this commit the game was completely unplayable by keyboard
— tiles and word rows were `<span>` containers with
`@mousedown.left.prevent` handlers, which fire only on pointer events.
After this commit Tab + Enter/Space activates a tile, focus rings are
visible against the dark theme, screen readers announce tile/word
labels, and live regions announce submit results.

#### New / changed
- `src/components/GameScreen.vue`:
  - Rack tile `<span>`s and player-word `<div>`s are now
    `<button type="button">` elements with the same `.tile` /
    `.word-row` classes preserved so visuals are unchanged.
  - Each rack tile carries `aria-label="Tile {letter}"` (`…, claimed`
    when in `consumption.loose`). Each word row carries
    `aria-label="Word {word}, {N} letters"` (`…, claimed` when
    consumed). Inner per-letter decoration `<span>`s inside a word-row
    button are `aria-hidden="true"` so AT only reads the row's
    aria-label, not the chopped-up letters.
  - Staging logic moved from `@mousedown.left.prevent` to `@click`. A
    no-op `@mousedown.prevent` is kept on these buttons solely to
    suppress input blur on pointer click. Native button semantics now
    handle keyboard activation (Enter on keydown, Space on keyup).
  - New `inputRef` is bound on the typed `<input>`. After every
    typed-mutating handler (`onTileClick`, `onWordClick`, `onClear`)
    the input is programmatically refocused so keyboard users keep
    typing without a manual Tab back.
  - Live regions: `.feedback` carries `role="status" aria-atomic="true"`
    and is rendered **unconditionally** (with empty text when no
    submission has happened) so the live region exists in the DOM
    before its content changes — some screen readers miss
    announcements when the region is created simultaneously with its
    text. The score is left as a static `<span>` (no live region) so
    SR users get one announcement per submit (the feedback line),
    not two; they can navigate to the score on demand. `#timer` gets
    explicit `aria-live="off"` so per-second tick updates don't
    spam screen readers.
  - The typed `<input>` got an `id="word-input-field"` and a paired
    visually-hidden `<label for="word-input-field" class="sr-only">
    Type a word</label>` — replaces the placeholder-only a11y
    anti-pattern.
- `style.css`:
  - `button.tile, button.word-row { appearance: none; … }` reset so
    the new `<button>` form looks identical to the prior
    `<span>`/`<div>` form. `button.word-row` additionally gets
    background/border/color resets and `text-align: left` since
    `<button>` defaults differ from `<div>`.
  - `:focus-visible` rule covering `.tile`, `.word-row`, `.action-btn`,
    `.mode-btn`: `outline: 3px solid #b59f3b; outline-offset: 2px;`
    (#b59f3b vs `#121213` ≈ 5.4:1 contrast ratio, satisfying WCAG
    2.4.11). No focus ring on mouse-only clicks (browsers handle
    `:focus-visible` heuristics natively).
  - `.sr-only` clip-path utility class for the visually-hidden input
    label.
- No domain-module changes (`game.js`, `scoring.js`, `pool.js`,
  `staging.js`, `dictionary.js`, `anagramRules.js`, `share.js`,
  `storage.js`, `trivialInflection.js` are untouched).

#### Tests added / updated
- `tests/gameScreenInteraction.test.js`:
  - Existing 14 click-to-stage tests retargeted from `trigger('mousedown')`
    to `trigger('click')` (matching the new event wiring; user-visible
    behavior unchanged).
  - New `describe('GameScreen accessibility', …)` block, 9 tests:
    each rack tile is a `<button type="button">`; each tile has an
    aria-label naming its letter; each word row is a button; each row
    has an aria-label naming the word; the typed input has an
    associated label (visible / hidden / aria-label); the feedback box
    has `role="status"` after a submission; the score region has
    `role="status"`; the timer has `aria-live="off"`; clicking a tile
    leaves focus on the typed input element (`document.activeElement`
    invariant, mounted with `attachTo: document.body`).
- `tests/app.smoke.test.js`:
  - Existing tile-click smoke retargeted from `mousedown` to `click`.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 141/141 passing (was 132; +9 new).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds in 0.6 s, JS ≈ 94 kB raw
  / 36 kB gzipped (CSS now 6.97 kB, was 6.54 kB; +0.4 kB for the new
  rules).
- `npm run dev` — boots; Vite serves the new `aria-label`,
  `:focus-visible`, and `.sr-only` rules. End-to-end keyboard /
  screen-reader interaction not driven from CLI; tested at the
  component-DOM level by the test suite.

### `feat/initial-game` — 7-day calendar grid on home screen (this commit)

Surfaces the existing Daily Challenge persistence layer visually as a
horizontal 7-cell strip on the home screen. Cells run oldest-first
left-to-right, ending at today; filled cells = days played, hollow
cells = days missed, an accent outline ring marks today regardless of
played/unplayed state. Matches the de-facto pattern used by
Wordle/Duolingo/GitHub heatmaps. No domain-module changes; no storage
schema change.

#### New / changed
- `src/storage.js` — new exported pure helper
  `recentDays(records, todayDate, count = 7)` returning an oldest-first
  array of `{ date, played, record? }` entries ending at `todayDate`.
  Reuses the existing internal `shiftDate` UTC arithmetic. `record`
  (full underlying entry) is attached only when `played` is true,
  leaving the shape forward-compatible with future per-cell features.
- `src/components/HomeScreen.vue` — new optional `recent` prop
  (`Array`, default `[]`). Renders a `.home-calendar` strip below the
  existing `.home-stats` row when `(streak > 0 || best > 0) &&
  recent.length > 0`. Wrapped in `<div role="group" aria-label="Last
  7 days activity">`. Each cell is a presentational `<div
  class="home-calendar-cell">` (intentionally non-interactive — no
  focus, no click) carrying `.played` when the entry is played and
  `.today` on the rightmost cell. Per-cell `aria-label` and `title`
  follow GitHub's pattern: `Today, score N, Friday April 25`,
  `Today, not played yet, Friday April 25`, `Score N, Tuesday April
  22`, or `Not played, Monday April 21`. Day-letter labels above
  each cell come from `['S','M','T','W','T','F','S']` indexed by UTC
  weekday. Helpers `weekdayLetter`, `humanDate`, `cellLabel` all
  parse the date string via `Date.UTC` to keep weekday computation
  aligned with the storage-key UTC convention.
- `src/components/App.vue` — `computeStats()` now also derives
  `recent: recentDays(records, today, 7)`. Stats shape grew from
  `{ streak, best, completedToday }` to
  `{ streak, best, completedToday, recent }`. The `<HomeScreen … />`
  template line gained `:recent="stats.recent"`. Recompute timing is
  unchanged — same transitions (`returnHome`,
  `endGameWithResult`) refresh the calendar.
- `style.css` — new rules: `.home-calendar` (flex row, `gap: 6px`,
  `margin-top: 14px`, centered), `.home-calendar-day` (column flex),
  `.home-calendar-letter` (10 px gray uppercase, 1 px letter-spacing,
  color `#565758`), `.home-calendar-cell` (28×28 px, 2 px border
  `#3a3a3c`, 4 px radius, transparent fill), `.home-calendar-cell.played`
  (fill `#538d4e`, mirrors `.tile.used`), `.home-calendar-cell.today`
  (`outline: 2 px solid #b59f3b; outline-offset: 2 px` — same accent
  yellow used by `:focus-visible`). Mobile breakpoint
  (`@media (max-width: 480px)`) shrinks cells to 24×24 px.

#### Tests added
- `tests/storage.test.js` — 6 new `recentDays` unit tests: empty
  records returns 7 unplayed entries with the right oldest/newest
  dates; today-only attaches the record; mixed history marks the
  right indices; explicit `count` argument honored; month boundary;
  year boundary.
- `tests/homeScreen.test.js` (new file) — 6 component tests with
  Vue Test Utils + happy-dom: no calendar when `streak===0 &&
  best===0`; exactly 7 cells when history exists; only the rightmost
  cell carries `.today`; only `played: true` entries get `.played`;
  every cell has a non-empty `aria-label` whose content reflects
  today/played/unplayed state; the `.home-calendar` wrapper has
  `role="group"` and a non-empty `aria-label`.
- `tests/app.smoke.test.js` — extended the existing
  seeded-localStorage test to also assert `.home-calendar` exists
  and the rightmost `.home-calendar-cell` carries both `.today` and
  `.played` (today was seeded).

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 151/151 passing (was 139; +12 new + 1 extension).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly in 0.6 s.
  CSS now 7.57 kB (was 6.97 kB; +0.6 kB for the new rules); JS
  unchanged at ≈95 kB raw / 36.9 kB gzipped.
- `npm run dev` — boots; serves the new `.home-calendar` markup and
  rules. Verified via the test suite at component-DOM level; full
  end-to-end manual click-through not run from CLI.

### `feat/initial-game` — `prefers-reduced-motion` honouring (this commit)

Closes the open follow-up "`prefers-reduced-motion` honouring on the
tile pop-in animation." Adds a single `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
reduce)` block to `style.css` that neutralises the rack tile pop-in
keyframe, the `.tile.clickable:hover` translate, and all the short
transitions on tiles, word rows, action buttons, and mode buttons —
honouring WCAG 2.3.3 (Animation from Interactions, Level AAA;
sufficient technique W3C C39). Pure CSS commit; no JS, no Vue
templates, no domain modules, no new dependencies.

#### What changed
- `style.css` — appended a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
  block at the end of the file. Two rules:
  1. A universal-selector reset (`*, *::before, *::after`) setting
     `animation-duration: 0.01ms !important`,
     `animation-iteration-count: 1 !important`, and
     `transition-duration: 0.01ms !important`. Using `0.01ms` (not
     `0` / `none`) preserves `animationend` / `transitionend` event
     firing for any future JS that might depend on them.
     `animation-iteration-count: 1 !important` is included even
     though we have no infinite animations today: an infinite
     animation reduced to `0.01ms` duration still loops on the event
     loop, so capping iterations is the canonical safety belt.
  2. A targeted `.tile.clickable:hover { transform: none; }` rule.
     Without this, the universal `transition-duration` reset alone
     would still let the element *snap* to `translateY(-1px)` on
     hover — visible 1 px jump. The targeted override removes the
     end state entirely.
- `tests/reducedMotion.test.js` (new) — 5 tests that read `style.css`
  as text and assert (a) the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
  reduce)` block exists; (b) inside it: `animation-duration: 0.01ms
  !important`, `animation-iteration-count: 1 !important`,
  `transition-duration: 0.01ms !important`; (c) inside it:
  `.tile.clickable:hover { … transform: none … }`. The block is
  isolated via brace-counting so the assertions only match content
  inside the media block. Headless DOMs (jsdom, happy-dom) do not
  evaluate `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` against any system
  setting, so direct DOM-computed-style tests are not viable —
  text-inspection of the CSS file is the W3C / CSS-Tricks consensus
  pattern for plain CSS. (Verified independently by the
  knowledge-researcher subagent.)
- `src/components/docs.md` — extended the "Live-region policy in
  `GameScreen`" bullet's enumeration of what `style.css` hosts to
  include the new `prefers-reduced-motion` block, with the rationale
  (`0.01ms` vs `none`, hover-transform-none follow-up, keyframes
  preserved for users without the OS preference).

#### What did NOT change
- No JS files, no `.vue` templates.
- No domain modules.
- No `package.json`, no new dependencies.
- No keyframe rules deleted. The `@keyframes pop-in` definition
  remains; users without the OS preference still see the animation.
- No existing tests changed. Cascade order is preserved (the new
  block is appended after every existing rule).

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 154/154 passing (was 149; +5 new reducedMotion).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly in 0.66 s.
  CSS now 7.80 kB (was 7.57 kB; +0.23 kB for the new block); JS
  unchanged at ≈95 kB raw / 36.86 kB gzipped.
- End-to-end OS-level reduced-motion behavior was not driven from
  CLI; it is verifiable in Chrome DevTools → Rendering → "Emulate
  CSS media feature `prefers-reduced-motion`."

#### Reviewer parity note
- An earlier draft of the block also included `scroll-behavior: auto
  !important`, recommended by web.dev. Dropped before commit because
  the codebase declares no `scroll-behavior: smooth` anywhere — the
  reset would be dead code. YAGNI.

### `feat/initial-game` — Per-day detail popover on calendar cells (this commit)

Surfaces the existing per-day record data (`score`, `longestWord`,
`durationMs`, `completedAt`) that the v5 persistence layer has been
storing all along. The 7-day calendar strip on the home screen
previously rendered all cells as non-interactive `<div role="img">`
elements with state shown only via fill color and a tooltip-only date
label. Played cells now render as `<button type="button">` and open a
small accessible popover when clicked. No domain-module changes; no
storage schema change.

#### New / changed
- `src/components/HomeScreen.vue`:
  - Played calendar cells flip from `<div role="img">` to
    `<button type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded
    aria-controls>`. Unplayed cells stay as `<div role="img">`
    (no behavior or accessible-name change).
  - New transient state: `selectedIndex` ref (null when closed,
    cell index when open), `panelPos` (`{top, left}` for fixed
    positioning), `cellRefs` (template-ref array, populated only
    for played cells via a `setCellRef(i)` factory), `panelRef`
    on the popover panel.
  - `onCellClick(i, ev)` captures `ev.currentTarget.getBounding
    ClientRect()`, computes a `position: fixed` anchor below the
    cell, viewport-edge clamped to the viewport (`PANEL_W = 220`,
    8 px margin), and sets `selectedIndex = i`.
  - `closePopover({restoreFocus = true})` sets `selectedIndex
    = null`. Triggered by the close button (restore focus), Escape
    via `onDocKeydown` (restore focus), or outside `mousedown` via
    `onDocMousedown` (do NOT restore focus — the user's pointer
    has already landed somewhere else; pulling focus back would
    interrupt their next action). Outside-mousedown uses
    `event.composedPath()` to skip the panel itself and any cell
    trigger.
  - Central `watch(selectedIndex, …)` is the open/close state
    machine: registers the document-level `mousedown` + `keydown`
    listeners on open, removes them on close, calls
    `panelRef.focus()` on `nextTick()` after open, and
    `cellRefs[prev].focus()` on close. `onBeforeUnmount` removes
    listeners defensively.
  - `watch(() => props.recent, …)` auto-closes the popover when
    `recent` changes (e.g. after finishing a daily run and
    returning home), avoiding stale data.
  - Popover panel rendered via `<Teleport to="body">` so its
    fixed-position layering is independent of any parent stacking
    context. Panel: `role="dialog" aria-modal="false"
    aria-labelledby="day-popover-title" tabindex="-1"`. Contents:
    human date heading (`Tuesday, April 22`), score, longest word,
    duration formatted as `m:ss` via `formatDuration(ms)`. Close
    button: `<button class="day-popover-close" aria-label="Close">×`.
- `style.css`:
  - `button.home-calendar-cell` reset (`appearance: none; padding:
    0; cursor: pointer`), hover `transform: translateY(-1px)`, and
    `:focus-visible` outline (mirrors the existing tile
    focus-ring palette).
  - `.day-popover` (220 px fixed panel, dark `#1f1f20` background,
    border, rounded corners, `box-shadow` for lift, `z-index:
    1000`).
  - `.day-popover-close`, `.day-popover-title`, `.day-popover-row`,
    `.day-popover-label`, `.day-popover-value` with the existing
    palette (`#3a3a3c` border, `#818384` label gray, `#d7dadc`
    value).

#### Tests added
- `tests/homeScreen.test.js` — new
  `describe('HomeScreen day-detail popover', …)` block, 12 tests:
  initial-no-popover; clicking-unplayed-cell-does-not-open;
  played-cell-trigger-exposes-aria-haspopup-and-aria-expanded;
  click-opens-dialog (`role="dialog" aria-modal="false"`);
  popover-content (score, longest word, duration formatted as
  `m:ss`); human-date-heading; close-button-dismisses;
  Escape-dismisses; outside-mousedown-dismisses (manual
  `document.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('mousedown', {bubbles:
  true, composed: true}))`); focus-returns-to-trigger after Escape
  (`document.activeElement === triggerCell` with
  `attachTo: document.body`); focus-does-NOT-return after outside-
  mousedown (intentional asymmetry — the user's pointer has
  already moved); switch-on-different-cell shows the new cell's
  record and not the previous one.

#### Documentation
- `src/components/docs.md` — extended HomeScreen section with the
  played/unplayed cell render split, the popover state shape and
  `<Teleport to="body">` rationale, the central
  `watch(selectedIndex)` state machine, the three dismiss paths,
  the focus-return contract, and the `watch(() => props.recent)`
  auto-clear. Added "Things to Know" entries for one-popover-at-a-
  time, outside-mousedown trigger exclusion (flicker prevention
  when switching cells), teleport / z-index rationale, and
  optional-chaining defense on `entry.record`.
- `src/docs.md` — tightened the Recent-days bullet to enumerate
  the underlying record fields and notes that the HomeScreen
  popover now reads them on click.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 166/166 passing (was 154; +12 new). Existing
  calendar tests still pass on the `<button>`-instead-of-`<div>`
  markup for played cells.
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly in 0.6 s.
  CSS now 9.18 kB (was 7.80 kB; +1.38 kB for the new popover
  rules); JS at 100.98 kB raw / 39.03 kB gzipped (was 100.89 kB
  / 39.00 kB; +0.1 kB for the popover state machine).

### `feat/initial-game` — Reject pure-rearrangement of existing words (this commit)

Closes the headline bug from the previous WIP note: `side → dies →
side → dies …` was a legal infinite loop because `canFormWord` only
rejected exact replay, not same-length rearrangement of a single
consumed parent. The fix replaces the string-equality replay check
with a more general **max-parent-length growth check** that subsumes
both cases. Independently confirmed against the canonical Snatch /
Anagrams rule (Wikipedia, Bananagrammer, BoardGameGeek): every steal
must add at least one tile from the pool.

#### What changed
- `src/anagramRules.js` — `canFormWord` now rejects with reason
  `'no-new-play'` whenever `consumedWords.length > 0 && typed.length
  <= max(parent.length)`. Replaces the previous
  `consumedWords.includes(word)` exact-replay check, which it
  subsumes (replay = same word, same length, single parent). No new
  failure code; no signature change; failure-priority table
  unchanged.
- `src/components/GameScreen.vue` — `reasonText('no-new-play')`
  message broadened from "That is the same word that is already on
  the table." to "You must add at least one new letter when using an
  existing word." (single message covers both replay and
  rearrangement cases).
- No domain-module signature changes. No CSS, no storage, no
  dictionary, no lemma changes. No new dependencies.

#### Why it's a one-line rule
- **Loose-only draws** (no parents): rule guarded off by
  `consumedWords.length > 0`.
- **Single-parent + loose growth** (`nub + s → snub`): typed.length
  4 > parent.length 3 — passes.
- **Multi-parent merges** (`res + side → resides`): typed.length
  7 > max(3, 4) — passes. In general, ≥2 parents force `typed.length
  ≥ Σ parent_lengths ≥ max_parent_length + min_other_parent_length ≥
  max + 3 > max`, so multi-parent always passes.
- **Same-length single-parent rearrangement** (`side → dies`):
  typed.length 4 ≤ max parent length 4 — rejected. (NEW.)
- **Exact replay** (`rook → rook`): typed.length 4 ≤ 4 — rejected.
  (Same outcome as before, narrower check.)

#### Tests added
- `tests/anagramRules.test.js`:
  - `rejects same-length single-parent rearrangement (dies from
    side)` — headline bug regression. Asserts
    `{ ok: false, reason: 'no-new-play' }`.
  - The pre-existing replay-rejection test (`rook from rook with no
    new letters`) was sharpened to also assert
    `reason === 'no-new-play'`, locking the new code path's behavior
    on the replay subcase.
  - `accepts a multi-parent merge that exceeds the longest parent
    (trains from rat + sin)` — locks the load-bearing invariant that
    the growth check never accidentally rejects multi-parent
    merges. Previously untested at the `canFormWord` level.
- All existing positive tests (`brook from rook + b`, `snub from nub
  + s`, `redefine from refine + d + e`) act as regression coverage
  and continue to pass.

#### Documentation
- `src/docs.md` — updated the "Word legality" bullet to describe the
  broadened semantics of the `'no-new-play'` reason: covers any
  consume-without-growth play (replay or same-length single-parent
  rearrangement); multi-parent merges always pass.
- `RESEARCH-NOTES.md` — appended a "Pure-rearrangement bug fix"
  section with the canonical-rule citations, decision rationale, and
  out-of-scope notes (the stricter "must rearrange ≥2 parent tiles"
  variant is rejected because the spec accepts `Nub + S → Snub`).

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 168/168 passing (was 166; +2 new tests, +1 sharpened
  existing test asserting the reason code).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly. No bundle-size
  change (one-line logic edit, one string update).
- `npm run dev` — boots; the new feedback message is wired through
  `reasonText` and renders in the live region as before.

### `feat/initial-game` — Per-day share-text replay (this commit)

Closes the open follow-up "Share-text replay from a past day on the
calendar popover." Played-day cells in the home-screen calendar
popover now expose a Share button that copies the full Wordle-style
emoji grid for that past run. Old records (written before this commit
existed, no `history` field) continue to load and just don't show the
button — no degraded mode.

#### What changed
- `src/storage.js` — `recordDailyResult({ ..., history })` now
  persists `history` inside the record when provided. No
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump: the change is purely additive-optional, so
  legacy v1 records continue to load (their popover just won't show
  the Share button).
- `src/components/App.vue` — `endGameWithResult` forwards
  `history: result.history` into `recordDailyResult` so future daily
  records carry their transformation chain.
- `src/components/HomeScreen.vue` —
  - Imports `generateShareText` from `../share.js`.
  - Adds `copiedDay` ref + `copiedTimer` (transient share-button
    feedback) and `canShareSelected` computed (gated on
    `Array.isArray(selectedEntry.record.history) && length > 0`).
  - New `async shareSelectedDay()` mirrors `ScoreScreen.onShare`:
    builds share text via `generateShareText({ mode: 'daily', date,
    score, longestWord, totalTimeMs: durationMs, history,
    streak: 0 })`, awaits `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, flips
    `copiedDay = true` for 2 s on success, falls back to
    `window.prompt('Copy your result:', text)` on rejection.
  - `closePopover` now also resets `copiedDay = false` and clears any
    pending `setTimeout`, so reopening always starts in the
    un-copied state.
  - Template: `<button class="action-btn day-popover-share">` rendered
    inside the popover panel only when `canShareSelected` is true.
- `style.css` — new `.day-popover-share` rule: `margin-top: 12px`,
  full width, slightly tighter padding/font than the default
  `.action-btn`.

#### What did NOT change
- No `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump (per CLAUDE.md YAGNI; additive-optional
  fields don't justify migration plumbing — the next genuinely
  breaking change will introduce one).
- No new dependency.
- No domain-module signature changes (`generateShareText` already
  accepted `history` and `streak`).
- No retroactive streak calculation: past-day shares always pass
  `streak: 0`, so the share footer never carries `Streak <N>`.
  Streak is a "right now" concept; reconstructing it as it stood on a
  past date would require walking records back from each share-target
  date — deliberately out of scope.
- No shared clipboard composable. The `shareSelectedDay()` shape
  duplicates `ScoreScreen.onShare`; a single duplicate isn't
  premature abstraction.

#### Tests added
- `tests/storage.test.js` — 2 new tests under
  `recordDailyResult — history field`:
  - "persists a history array round-trip when provided" — write
    record with `history: [{word, parents}, …]`, read back via
    `loadStore`, assert equality.
  - "loads a v1 record without a history field and returns history
    as undefined" — pre-seed `localStorage` with a legacy v1 shape
    (no `history` key); assert `loadStore` returns the record with
    `record.history === undefined`.
- `tests/homeScreen.test.js` — 6 new tests under
  `HomeScreen day-detail popover — share`:
  - Share button rendered when `record.history` is non-empty.
  - Share button NOT rendered when `record.history` is absent.
  - Share button NOT rendered when `record.history` is `[]`.
  - Clicking Share calls `navigator.clipboard.writeText` once with
    text containing the entry's date AND score AND at least one
    Wordle-grid emoji (`🟩` or `🟨`).
  - Switching to a different played cell after copying resets the
    button label from "Copied!" back to "Share" (race-leak
    regression).
  - Falls back to `window.prompt` (with text containing the score)
    when `clipboard.writeText` rejects.
  - Clipboard mock installed per-test via `Object.defineProperty(
    navigator, 'clipboard', { value: { writeText: vi.fn() },
    configurable: true, writable: true })`. Per-test
    `vi.restoreAllMocks()` plus a defensive cleanup that removes
    any `[role="dialog"]` left attached to `document.body` (Teleport
    artifacts can otherwise leak across tests). Pattern documented
    in RESEARCH-NOTES.md under v11.

#### Race-condition guard
`shareSelectedDay` captures `selectedIndex.value` as `startedFor`
*before* awaiting `navigator.clipboard.writeText`. After the await
(success or reject), if `selectedIndex.value !== startedFor`, the
handler returns early without setting `copiedDay = true` or invoking
`window.prompt`. Without this guard, a clipboard write that resolved
*after* the user closed the popover (or switched cells) would (a)
flash "Copied!" on the next opened popover that the user never
shared, and (b) leak a stale `setTimeout(2000)` that would silently
flip the next session's button label mid-view. `onCellClick` also
proactively resets `copiedDay` on cell-to-cell switch (which doesn't
go through `closePopover`), so the watcher's open-branch
side-effects (focus management, listener registration) are
unaffected.

#### Documentation
- `src/docs.md` — Persistence-layer bullet now documents the optional
  `history` field on the persisted record shape; Recent-days bullet
  notes `history` flows through `recentDays` and powers the new
  per-day Share button. The "Schema versioning is strict-equal"
  Things-to-Know entry now distinguishes breaking changes (require
  bump) from additive-optional fields (do not).
- `src/components/docs.md` — App.vue daily-recording bullet documents
  the new `history` arg; HomeScreen popover bullet adds `copiedDay`
  to the transient state list; new dedicated "popover Share button"
  bullet covers the visibility gate, `streak: 0` rationale, the
  intentional `ScoreScreen.onShare` parallel, and the
  `copiedDay`-resets-on-close invariant.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 176/176 passing (was 168; +2 storage + 6 homeScreen).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly in 0.6 s. CSS
  now 9.26 kB (was 9.18 kB; +0.08 kB for the `.day-popover-share`
  rule); JS at 101.79 kB raw / 39.24 kB gzipped (was 100.98 kB /
  39.03 kB; +0.8 kB for the new computed/handler/template).
- `npm run dev` — boots; HomeScreen popover now renders the Share
  button on played cells whose record has a non-empty `history`.

### `feat/initial-game` — Local-midnight Daily Challenge reset (this commit)

Switches the Daily Challenge puzzle seed and storage record key from
UTC to the user's local-calendar date, so the puzzle resets at local
midnight. Closes the open follow-up "Local-midnight reset for the
Daily Challenge (industry consensus over UTC)." NYT Wordle, NYT
Connections, and most daily-puzzle games follow this convention; the
prior UTC behavior surprised users in non-UTC timezones (Pacific time
saw the new puzzle at 5 PM the prior local day).

#### What changed
- `src/dateKey.js` (new) — single source of truth for the daily date
  string. Exports `formatLocalDate(date)` (pure: `${y}-${pad(m+1)}-${
  pad(d)}` from local-time accessors) and `todayLocal()` (returns
  `formatLocalDate(new Date())`). Manual local-time formatting was
  preferred over `toLocaleDateString('en-CA')` per
  [tc39/ecma402#891](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/891) — for
  a primary key, `Intl` is too clever.
- `src/components/App.vue` — deleted the private `function todayUTC()
  { return new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10) }` and replaced both
  callsites (`computeStats()` and `startGame()`) with `todayLocal()`
  imported from `../dateKey.js`. Function-call shape unchanged. The
  lock-at-game-start architecture (`game.value.date` captured once in
  `startGame`) is preserved verbatim — a session that crosses local
  midnight finishes on the date it began (Wordle convention).

#### What did NOT change
- `src/storage.js#shiftDate` continues to use `Date.UTC` math
  internally. That is opaque-string `±N`-day arithmetic on a
  `YYYY-MM-DD` label — timezone-agnostic, not a semantic UTC
  commitment. Re-described in the noridocs to make this explicit.
- `src/components/HomeScreen.vue#parseDate/weekdayLetter/humanDate`
  continue to parse via `Date.UTC` for stable cross-TZ weekday
  rendering. The input is just a calendar-date label.
- No `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump. The schema *shape* is unchanged; only the
  *interpretation* of date keys flips from UTC to local. A migration
  framework will land when the first genuinely breaking shape change
  appears (per the v11 RESEARCH-NOTES decision).
- No migration code. Existing UTC-keyed records orphan harmlessly
  (CLAUDE.md YAGNI; for most users the divergence is at most one
  calendar day).

#### Tests added
- `tests/dateKey.test.js` (new) — 3 unit tests:
  - `formatLocalDate` zero-pads single-digit months and days
    (`new Date(2026, 0, 5, 12, 0, 0)` → `'2026-01-05'`).
  - `formatLocalDate` formats end-of-year (`new Date(2026, 11, 31,
    12, 0, 0)` → `'2026-12-31'`).
  - `todayLocal` wired to system clock — `vi.setSystemTime(new
    Date(2026, 3, 25, 12, 0, 0))` → `todayLocal()` returns
    `'2026-04-25'`.
- `tests/app.smoke.test.js` "shows Streak and Best..." — switched from
  `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` (UTC) to
  `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.setSystemTime(new Date(2026, 3, 25, 12,
  0, 0))` plus hardcoded `today = '2026-04-25'`/`yesterday =
  '2026-04-24'`. CI-stable across host timezones; exercises the new
  local-date path through the App boundary. Pinning to local-noon
  keeps both UTC and local on the same calendar day in any reasonable
  timezone, so the seed and the App's "today" agree.

#### Documentation
- `src/docs.md` — Determinism flow bullet now references
  `src/dateKey.js`. Persistence-layer / `recentDays` bullets:
  "consecutive UTC days" → "consecutive local-calendar days" and
  clarification that `shiftDate` is opaque-string arithmetic.
  Things-to-Know "Date string..." rewritten to reflect local-calendar
  semantics, link to `src/dateKey.js`, call out the lock-at-start
  pattern, and disclaim `shiftDate`'s UTC math as a stable-arithmetic
  trick.
- `src/components/docs.md` — App.vue date-convention bullet:
  `todayUTC()` → `todayLocal()` from `src/dateKey.js`. HomeScreen
  popover Share-button bullet: streak relative to "today's UTC date"
  → "today's local-calendar date." Replays bullet: "same UTC day" →
  "same local day."

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 179/179 passing (was 176; +3 dateKey tests). The smoke
  test that was reworked still passes; no regressions elsewhere.
- The lock-at-start invariant is structurally preserved by the
  existing `App.vue` architecture (date captured once in `startGame`,
  read from `game.value.date` thereafter); no new test was added for
  it because verifying it requires reaching into component internals
  for marginal value.

### `feat/initial-game` — Sticky-claim trail (this commit)

Closes the v4 known-limitation note "with duplicate letters, clicking
the leftmost-of-letter claimed tile causes the rightmost-of-letter to
lose its highlight instead." Replaces the typed-string-as-source-of-
truth + greedy-multiset highlight model with an identity-bound
**claim trail**: clicks record *which specific tile* was clicked, so
click-to-remove un-highlights that tile, not the leftmost-of-letter
match. Independently confirmed industry-pattern parity with chip /
multi-token inputs (Downshift `useMultipleSelection`, shadcn-vue
`TagsInput`, PrimeVue `Chips`) — array of identity-bearing entries is
the model; the text input is a transient editor for the next entry.

#### What changed
- `src/staging.js` — `highlightConsumption(typed, pool, trail?)`
  gains an optional 3rd parameter. When `trail` is undefined or
  contains no identity entries (only `kind:'typed'` or empty), the
  function falls through to the legacy `findConsumption` +
  `partialHighlight` path — pre-existing 2-arg call sites unchanged.
  When `trail` contains any identity entry (`kind:'loose'` or
  `kind:'word'` with a valid `sourceIndex`), those indices pre-claim
  the highlight set and a residual greedy pass over the
  `kind:'typed'` letters fills in unclaimed tiles/words. Identity-
  claimed tiles are excluded from the greedy pass (so a typed `r`
  after clicking tile 0 (R) picks tile 1, not tile 0 again). Stale
  `sourceIndex` values are silently ignored via bounds-check.
- `src/components/GameScreen.vue` — replaces `const typed = ref('')`
  with `const trail = ref([])` plus a writable `computed({get, set})`
  named `typed`. Getter joins trail letters into the v-model'd input
  value. Setter diffs old/new strings: append-suffix pushes
  `kind:'typed'` entries; backspace-prefix pops trail tail; any
  other divergence (paste, mid-edit, `setValue` from tests) **demotes**
  the trail to a flat array of `kind:'typed'` entries.
  - `onTileClick(i)`: identity entry exists → splice it (sticky-
    identity removal); else greedy claim → splice first `kind:'typed'`
    entry whose letter matches; else push new identity entry.
  - `onWordClick(i)`: any `{kind:'word', sourceIndex:i}` entries →
    splice them all atomically; else greedy claim → strip word's
    letters from typed entries; else push N identity entries.
  - `onClear()` and submit-success path reset `trail.value = []`
    directly (skipping the setter, which would demote rather than
    cleanly clear). Submit success clears trail because consumed
    loose tiles shift `looseLetters` indices, invalidating
    `sourceIndex` values; draws append to `looseLetters`, leaving
    indices stable, so trail survives across draws.
- No domain-module changes (`anagramRules`, `game`, `pool`,
  `scoring`, `share`, `storage`, `dictionary`, `trivialInflection`,
  `multiset`, `prng`, `tiles`, `dateKey` are untouched).
- No CSS changes. No new dependencies.

#### Tests added
- `tests/staging.test.js` — 7 new tests under `highlightConsumption
  with claim trail`: identity over leftmost-first, two-tile identity,
  greedy fallback for typed-only entries (parity with old behavior),
  mixed identity + typed, identity excluded from greedy fallback,
  identity word claim over greedy, all-typed word fallback.
- `tests/gameScreenInteraction.test.js` — 6 new tests under
  `GameScreen sticky-claim trail`: headline regression (rack
  `[R,R,T,S]`, click 0, click 1, click 0 → tile 0 unclaimed, tile 1
  claimed); preserves identity across an unrelated typed letter;
  Clear empties trail and highlight; submit-success resets identity;
  invalid submit preserves identity; word-row second click preserves
  separately-clicked tile's identity.

#### Documentation
- `src/docs.md` — Core Implementation gains a "Staging / highlight
  model" bullet documenting the trail entry shape table, the
  fall-through-to-legacy contract, the hybrid identity-pre-claim +
  greedy-residue path, and the bounds-check / silent-ignore
  semantics. Things-to-Know gains entries on the 2-arg back-compat
  guarantee and on why trail identity exists (the duplicate-letter
  leftmost-claim regression).
- `src/components/docs.md` — Core Implementation gains
  "GameScreen — staging-trail model" and "GameScreen — click handler
  decision tree" bullets. Things-to-Know replaces the old
  "typed input is source of truth" entry with five new entries:
  trail-as-source-of-truth, keyboard-vs-click unified through trail,
  click-to-remove preserves clicked-tile identity (with
  CURRENT-PROGRESS.md cross-link), trail-clears-on-submit-not-draw
  (with `sourceIndex`-validity rationale), and demote-on-divergence
  safety net.
- `RESEARCH-NOTES.md` — appended a "Sticky-claim trail / staged-tile
  model (v13 commit)" section with the bug analysis, design
  decisions, edge cases (Android Chrome composition input,
  reconciliation safety net), test plan, and out-of-scope list.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 192/192 passing (was 179; +13 new tests).
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly in 0.6 s. CSS
  unchanged at 9.26 kB. JS at 103.64 kB raw / 39.89 kB gzipped (was
  101.79 kB / 39.24 kB; +1.85 kB raw for the trail logic + writable
  computed).

#### Known limitation
- Mobile / IME composition input is not supported through the new
  setter path. The setter only handles append-suffix /
  backspace-prefix / divergent diffs. `insertCompositionText` events
  on Android Chrome / GBoard arrive as full-string replacements,
  which trigger demote — losing identity. The game is desktop-first
  and English-only; mobile composition support is deferred.

### `feat/initial-game` — Twitter-budget share-grid truncation (this commit)

Closes the open follow-up "Truncate share grid for very long runs
(Twitter 280-char limit) — not hit by typical games but possible."
Marathon Anagrams runs (25–30 words with steals) silently get cut by
Twitter, making the share look broken (mid-row truncation, missing
footer). After this commit, over-budget grids render as the first 3
emoji rows + a single `… +N more` line + the last 3 emoji rows;
header and footer are emitted verbatim. Common-case daily plays
(5–10 words) bypass the truncation branch and emit byte-identical
output to the prior implementation.

#### What changed
- `src/share.js`:
  - New module-level constants `MAX_WEIGHTED_LENGTH = 260`,
    `HEAD_KEEP = 3`, `TAIL_KEEP = 3` (not exported).
  - New private helper `weightedLength(text)` — iterates by code
    point (`for (const ch of text)`) and applies the rule
    `cp <= 0x7F ? 1 : 2` (ASCII = 1 weight, everything else = 2).
    Conservative over-approximation of the `twitter-text` v3 weighted
    model: emoji squares 🟩 / 🟨 (U+1F7E9 / U+1F7E8) score 2 weight
    each (correct); rare punctuation like the em-dash `—` and middle-
    dot `·` over-count by 1 each (≤ 3 weight total per share, well
    inside the 20-weight buffer between our 260 budget and Twitter's
    280 hard limit).
  - New private helper `assemble(header, rows, footer)` — extracted
    from the existing assembly logic so the truncated and untruncated
    paths share one format definition. No behavior change.
  - `generateShareText` gains a single conditional branch: if
    `rows.length > HEAD_KEEP + TAIL_KEEP` AND
    `weightedLength(fullText) > MAX_WEIGHTED_LENGTH`, splice
    `[...rows.slice(0,3), '… +N more', ...rows.slice(-3)]` and
    re-`assemble`. Otherwise return the full assembled text.
- No domain-module changes (`game.js`, `pool.js`, `scoring.js`,
  `anagramRules.js`, `staging.js`, `storage.js`, `dictionary.js`,
  `trivialInflection.js`, `dateKey.js`, `tiles.js`, `prng.js` are all
  untouched). No `.vue` template changes; popover Share button on
  HomeScreen and Score screen Share button continue calling
  `generateShareText` with the same arguments — truncation flows
  through automatically.
- No CSS changes. No new dependencies. No `npm i twitter-text` —
  twitter-text is a 100kB+ dependency we'd be importing for ~5
  lines of weighting logic, so we open-coded the conservative
  approximation instead.
- No `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump. Persisted `history` arrays in
  localStorage round-trip through the same truncation when popover-
  replayed.

#### Why head + tail + `… +N more`, not re-encoding
Long-form Wordle variants like `64ordle.au` solve the 280-char
problem by re-encoding each guess as a single tier-color emoji
(packing 64 plays into ~64 emoji). We deliberately rejected that
approach for Anagrams: the per-row 🟨/🟩 split is the share's most
informative signal — it shows how much of each play was *stolen*
from existing words vs *newly added* — and collapsing each row to a
single tier-emoji throws that away. Head + tail + count summary
keeps the structural meaning of the shown rows intact and the
non-Wordle-variant convention (truncation) is the right trade-off
for a game whose share text is small per row but variable in count.
Source citations and the full design write-up live in
RESEARCH-NOTES.md under "Share-grid truncation for Twitter 280-char
limit (v14 commit)."

#### Tests added
- `tests/share.test.js` — new `describe('generateShareText —
  truncation', …)` block, 8 tests:
  - "does not truncate when history fits within the share budget"
    (6 four-letter words; output contains all 6 rows verbatim, no
    `more` text).
  - "truncates when history overflows the share budget" (30 six-
    letter rows; output has ≤ 6 emoji rows, contains `+24 more`).
  - "preserves the header verbatim when truncated".
  - "preserves the full footer (Longest, Time, Streak) verbatim
    when truncated".
  - "keeps first 3 rows then elision then last 3 rows in original
    order when truncated" — uses uniquely-shaped emoji rows (head
    via parents `[]`/`['ab']`/`['abc']`, tail via parents `['x']`/
    `['xy']`/`['xyz']`) so each `rowFor(entry)` produces a distinct
    string. Asserts via `text.split('\n').filter(emoji-only)` plus
    `findIndex` for the elision marker.
  - "truncated output stays within Twitter weighted-length 280" —
    independently re-implements the conservative weight rule in
    the test file (5 lines) and asserts on the returned string.
  - "drops just one row when history has exactly 7 overflowing
    rows" (7 eighteen-letter rows → `+1 more`). The 30-row case
    above (`+24 more`) and this 7-row case bracket the dropped-
    count formula range.
  - "does not truncate when history has 6 or fewer rows even if
    oversized" (6 fifteen-letter rows; rows.length ≤ HEAD+TAIL so
    truncation suppressed even though weighted length may exceed
    260).
- All 14 previously-existing `share.test.js` tests pass without
  modification — they exercise small histories that don't hit the
  truncation path.

#### Documentation
- `src/docs.md` — extended the "Share text contract" bullet to note
  centralised assembly via `assemble()`. Added a new "Share text
  Twitter-budget truncation" Core-Implementation bullet covering
  the budget constant, kept-counts, elision format, suppression
  rule, and conservative weighting helper. Added a Things-to-Know
  entry "Share-text truncation chose head+tail over re-encoding to
  preserve the per-row 🟨/🟩 split" capturing the design rationale,
  the byte-identical guarantee for kept rows, and the
  test-observable-behaviour-not-constants policy.
- `src/components/docs.md` — extended the HomeScreen popover
  Share-button bullet to note that truncation flows through
  automatically for past-day shares (no popover-specific handling),
  cross-referencing `src/docs.md`.
- `RESEARCH-NOTES.md` — appended a "Share-grid truncation for
  Twitter 280-char limit (v14 commit)" section with `twitter-text`
  v3 spec citations, long-form-Wordle precedent (64ordle, etc.),
  the head-vs-tail design decision, the conservative
  ASCII-vs-non-ASCII weighting rationale, full test plan, and
  out-of-scope items.

#### Verified
- `npm test` — 202/202 passing (was 194; +8 new). 14 prior
  `share.test.js` tests untouched and still passing.
- `npm run build` — production bundle builds cleanly in 0.7 s.
  CSS unchanged at 9.26 kB. JS at 103.92 kB raw / 40.02 kB gzipped
  (was 103.64 kB / 39.89 kB; +0.28 kB raw for the truncation
  branch + helpers).

## Open follow-ups (next commits)

- Score-tier color heatmap on calendar cells (currently boolean
  filled/hollow). Add only if play-tester feedback says scores are hard
  to interpret at a glance.
- Streak protection / freeze tokens (cosmetic feature; YAGNI for now).
- A11y polish round 2: keyboard activation tests in a real browser
  (Playwright) instead of happy-dom; live-region announcements verified
  against an actual screen reader; reduce score-region announcement
  cadence if play-tester feedback says it's chatty.
- Mobile composition-input support for the trail-based input model
  (Android Chrome / GBoard `insertCompositionText` currently demotes
  the trail to all-typed entries, losing identity).
- Aria-label "alt text" share variant for screen readers (per Slate's
  Wordle-accessibility piece, wa11y.co does this for Wordle). Real
  concern but separate from the Twitter truncation work.
